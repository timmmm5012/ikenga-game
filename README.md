  After Beating three days’ journey, A page will come up teeling you that you beat the game

**How the game works**
This game is focused heavily on basic movement and controls, and a fixed camera. It is also primarily level based, and involves more action-based aspects of the book for the actual gameplay, and the other aspects such as the lore and mystery are within basic recaps between levels. If you happen to fail a level, the page will reload, resetting all of your progress in that level.
