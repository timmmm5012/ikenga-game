  <h2>Who's Next?</h2>

  <p>After Beating Bad Market, news of what happened to him, as well as reports of you, showed up all over the news. You have been trying to keep 'you being The Man' a secret from everyone, even your mother and best friends, but after getting mad at a few of them you partially transform into The Man and hit your other friend, Ruff Diamond. After doing so, everyone gets mad at you and suspicious of you. When you return home, you meet your mother's friend, Bonny. After a little while, you find out your mother is dating Bonny. Eventually, the three of you go out, and while driving on the highway, chaos erupts, and you find Mama Go-Slow - a criminal who walks oddly, robs people and has many thugs - at the center of it.</p>

  <h2>Third Fight: Mama Go-Slow</h2>

  <p>You are about to be transported to another level where you will have to fight Mama Go-Slow. You will have to defeat her to get to the next level. Use the arrow keys to control yourself. Some areas will be affected by gravity and you will fall if you enter them, or be blocked if you try entering one from the top. Press spacebar to hit him when you two are close (within 75px). Good luck!</p>
